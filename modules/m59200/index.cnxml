  <md:title>Java1036 Demystifying Glue and Struts, Part 3</md:title>
  <md:abstract>Baldwin shows you how to use custom methods that provide the functionality of glue and struts.  One of the methods produces an elastic spacer component with an upper limit on how far the component will stretch.  Another method provides the functionality of glue and struts in a single object.  Just for fun, Baldwin also shows you how to use a JButton as a container.</md:abstract>

Over the years, I have published a large number of tutorials in the areas of computer programming and 
	digital signal processing (DSP). As I have time available, I am converting the more significant of those tutorials into cnxml code and re-publishing them at

This tutorial may contain internal links to other tutorials that I have

good. In any event, if you search
